## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Modern Art Gallery](https://modernartgallery.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use Leaflet.js, which is a really cool tool to implement detailed, interactive maps.

### Continued development

Need to improve flexbox skills. Exact sizing and placements of items took some time in terms of making sure things were placed and sized correctly along with the webpage being responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) - This helped me learn how to use Leaftlet JS.
- [Leaflet starter guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVnimcQsuwk) - This video is a good walkthrough for beginners to Leaflet.js. It is a better visualization on how to get started than the starter guide on Leaftlet's website, in my opinion. The channel that uploaded that video has a whole series on Leaflet.
